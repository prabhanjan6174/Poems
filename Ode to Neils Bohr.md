## ODE TO NEILS BOHR - PRABHANJAN TELANG

The Dane walked briskly, \
as he walked, he ushered a revolution. \
He seeded Mosely's mind, and led us \
To a settling discovery.

He foresaw the future of atom, \
Way before Soddy coined "Isotope", \
The Dane knew, he wrote and forgot. \
He had this ingenuity never seen before.

He set out with the vision, \
To stabilize, the atom, newly forged. \
Rutherford saturnised the atom, \
The Dane, stabilized the rings.

He used Planck's "Quanta", \
and solved "Pickering-Fowler lines". \
He obtained a steady explanation, \
To Balmer and his lines.

The Dane walked briskly, \
as he walked, he ushered a revolution. \
No scientific mind could comprehend, \
his ideas and his thoughts. \
The conservatives renounced his atom. \
Even after denial, he stuck to his thoughts.

Years passed and steady progress was made, \
His ideas only grew, gained acclaim. \
The days of discussion and debate arrived, \
The very fabric of reality was at stake.

The Great Dane, struck true and struck hard, \
Quantum was the future, he knew. \
The Dane, Neils Bohr shook reality. \
In the end, even Einstein forgot relativity.
